            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My hobby is going to the gym and working out and playing softball. To work out you can do many different things like running or lifting weights. I mainly started working out to help me get better at softball. I started playing softball from a young age.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
            <p>I love it because working out takes me away from reality. I also have to push myself to get better so it helps me get mentally stronger.</p>
